                            NLMK produces steel slabs with various chemical properties and in different sizes. The
                            company uses slabs mainly in flat steel production at the Lipetsk plant, and also supplies
                            them to the Group’s mills in Europe and the USA, as well as to other consumers in Russia and
                            abroad. ‘Wide’ slabs are further converted into thick plates, including at NLMK’s
                            subsidiaries in Europe – DanSteel and Clabecq.
                        </p>

                        <p>Today, NLMK offers Russian consumers unique metal goods which previously had to be imported
                            into the country. For example, as part of its strategic partnership with OMK Group,
                            Novolipetsk manufactures slabs for the production of large-diameter pipes. In a record space
                            of time, specialists at the plant managed to set up production of steel slabs with more
                            rigorous demands on the chemical content and macrostructure of the metal, in standard sizes
                            that were new to Russia.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As a result, a completely Russian high-tech production chain was created as a substitute for
                            imports, dealing with everything from mining and smelting to the manufacture of products
                            important to the country. In less than two years of collaboration, Novolipetsk supplied OMK
                            with over one million tonnes of steel slabs for the manufacture of large diameter pipes used
                            in projects such as <p class="italic"> South Stream, Nord Stream</p>, and <p class="italic"> Power of Siberia</p>.
